<Password-Generator>

## Description

In this assignment I learned about prompt, alert, and confirm. I learned more about functions and for loops. I learned that being able to communicate my questions more clearly is a skill I need to improve on.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

https://melmealey.github.io/Password-Generator/
In case you ever need to have a randomly assigned password created, now it's as easy as the click of a button.

## Credits

The Ask BCS assistant was very helpful for this assignment.
I got my special characters from this website: https://owasp.org/www-community/password-special-characters
However I did not use all of them listed as some were causing issues (understandably)
